# Project-HK
  This game is a 3D bullet hell that allows you to change from first-person, third-person, and top-down camera views. The goal is to eliminate all of the enemies in order to break the sheild to kill the final boss. This game was also heavily inspired by Nier Automata. There are two versions of this game: one version is what the game ended up like after 24 hours, while the other is the game edited to fix bugs.
